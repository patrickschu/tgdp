##Protocol vowel measurements

###Delete all files that don't contain target sound
Logs are [here](www.utexas.edu)

###Measure in Praat using [Tyler's Script](http://lingtools.uoregon.edu/scripts/vowel_capture_aug09.praat) (adapted v on HD)

In Gluehwuermchen, the second vowel was extracted for short ue



Collect all output in a folder
**To Do:**
Add Textgridmaker to gildertfinder script
Make Praat match them automatically
--> measurements reproducible


###Use the [dataadder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickschu/tgdp/master/summer16/gilberttools/dataadder_0717.py) to automatically enter measurements into the spreadsheet.
Upload files to [Box](https://utexas.box.com/s/avmuz7tr96lckzwu9xoogvbnh7x6ae0u)
Call it gilbertsound_X.csv

###Plot vowel chart in R using the R script
Make F1/F2 and F1/F3 plots


###Notes
the /r/ that follows makes things difficult for all /ue/ words
the /i/ in honig is variably followed by a /k/ or a /ch/, or zero. Zero was excluded, but not always obvious
/i/: funeral is realized as begraebnis and beerdigung; the /g/ after /i/ can be plosive or fricative. 

####Future
Collect all in one spreadsheet for Gabmap
Map it
