create scripts to 

- select, access data from the web site, thru MYSQL(?)

- convert data to input applicable to mapping software and output as spreadsheet
		but: numerical versus nominal versus X
		
- create templates of mapping settings

- make available on Github and document so everyone can use it, independent of computer skills
