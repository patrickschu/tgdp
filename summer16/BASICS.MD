### How to run it
#### Preparations
It's easiest run to this script from the command line.

On Windows, you might have to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) first and [change](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2015/08/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-10/) the command line settings. 
Then you can use the command line tool (just type 'cmd' into the "All Programs" window). 

Download the script. You need [faveconverter_py2.py](https://github.com/patrickschu/txenglish/blob/master/faveconverter/faveconverter_py2.py) if you are running Python 2, [faveconverter_py3.py](https://github.com/patrickschu/txenglish/blob/master/faveconverter/faveconcerter_py3.py) if you are running Python 3. 
If you are unsure which version you have on your computer, type 

`python -V`

into the command line prompt.
