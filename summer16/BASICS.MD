### How to the scripts
#### Preparations
#### What do I need on my computer?
Most of it you will already have, the rest you can download for free. 

It's easiest run to these tools from the **command line**. On a Mac, all you need to do is open the Terminal (search for *Terminal.app* in the "Applications" folder). On Windows, you can use the command line tool (just type *cmd* into the "All Programs" window) or install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) (free), which is essentially a small Linux you can run inside your Windows environment. Within Cygwin, you can just follow the instructions for Mac. 

All the code is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Mac computers come with **Python** pre-installed. If you are running Windows, you might have to [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and install a copy of Python first (which is free).  
You will also, and this is the only real headache you will have to suffer through, [change](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2015/08/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-10/) the command line settings. 









Download the script. You need [faveconverter_py2.py](https://github.com/patrickschu/txenglish/blob/master/faveconverter/faveconverter_py2.py) if you are running Python 2, [faveconverter_py3.py](https://github.com/patrickschu/txenglish/blob/master/faveconverter/faveconcerter_py3.py) if you are running Python 3. 
If you are unsure which version you have on your computer, type 

`python -V`

into the command line prompt. 

#### Running the script
After navigating to the right version of the script, click on "Raw" on the top right of the screen. Download the resulting textfile. Use the Terminal to navigate to the folder you saved the script in. If it is in Downloads, for instance, do this:
